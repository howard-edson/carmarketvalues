run_searches.py
--------------- 
- removed some print statements no longer needed. refactored
the logging to just provide summary stats for each run, in 'info' mode.

- logging total execution time as well, so we can optimize when
it becomes necessary.


cmv_app/views.py
----------------
- updated search_report() function


cmv_app/templates/cmv_app
-------------------------
- updated search_report.html
